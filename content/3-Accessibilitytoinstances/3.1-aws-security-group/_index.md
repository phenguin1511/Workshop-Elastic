## 1. Introduction

**Security Group (SG)** is AWSâ€™s virtual firewall that controls inbound and outbound traffic for EC2 instances.  
Security Groups operate at the **instance level** (different from NACL, which operates at the subnet level).

---

## 2. Create Security Group for Bastion Host

1. Go to **AWS Management Console** â†’ **VPC** â†’ **Security Groups**.
2. Click **Create security group**.
3. Configure:
   - **Security group name**: `SG_Bastion`
   - **VPC**: select VPC `redis-ha-vpc`
4. **Inbound rules**:
   - **Type**: SSH (TCP port 22)
   - **Source**: Administratorâ€™s IP address (e.g., `203.x.x.x/32`)

5. **Outbound rules**:
   - By default, allow all outbound (`0.0.0.0/0`).

## 3. Create Security Group for Redis

1. Click **Create security group**.
2. Configure:
   - **Security group name**: `SG_Redis`
   - **VPC**: `redis-ha-vpc`
3. **Inbound rules**:
   - **Type**: Custom TCP
   - **Port range**: `6379` (Redis TLS)
   - **Source**: `SG_Bastion` and/or `SG_AppServer`

4. **Outbound rules**:
   - Keep default allow-all outbound, or restrict according to security requirements.

## 4. Result

After creation, you will have:

- `SG_Bastion`: Allows SSH from the admin IP to the Bastion Host.
- `SG_Redis`: Only allows Redis port access from Bastion Host or App Server.

---

## ðŸ’¡ Technical Notes

- Only open **necessary ports**; avoid using `0.0.0.0/0` for sensitive ports like 22 or 6379.
- You can use **Security Group Reference** (e.g., `SG_Bastion`) instead of IP for easier management when scaling.
- Default outbound is **Allow All**, but it can be restricted for enhanced security.
- Security Groups are **stateful**: If inbound is allowed, the corresponding outbound response is automatically allowed.
