## 1. Introduction

An **Internet Gateway (IGW)** is a component that enables a VPC to connect to the Internet.  
The IGW is attached to a VPC and used in public subnets through a route table.

   - **Name tag**: `redis-ha-igw`  
     > *This name helps easily identify the IGW serving the `redis-ha-vpc`.*

4. Click **Create internet gateway** to proceed.

5. After creation, select **Attach to VPC** and attach it to the `redis-ha-vpc`.

## ðŸ’¡ Technical Notes

- **0.0.0.0/0** means allowing Internet access from all IP addresses.  
  âžœ Only apply this to **public subnets** containing resources that require Internet access (e.g., Bastion Host).  
- Ensure **NACL** and **Security Group** rules are configured properly to limit allowed ports and source IPs.
- An IGW can be attached to **only 1 VPC**.
- Each VPC needs **only 1 IGW**, which can serve multiple public subnets.
